- Days Completed: 0/30
- Current Streak: 0 days

## Daily Log
### Day 1: 01/05/2025 - Working with Arrays
-Completed all exercises: 
                Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns statistics (min, max, mean, median)
                Implement a function that chunks an array into groups of a specified size
                Write a function that removes duplicates from an array using multiple approaches
                Create a utility that finds the intersection of two arrays
                
-Key learnings: filter and reduce are powerful array methods
                indexOf() returns a -1 when the element passed to it is not found, hence why it has been used in the for loop to remove duplicates in an array
                indexOf() always returns the first occurrence of the element in an array, hence being very useful in removing duplicates
                Another method to remove duplicates is using Set() which takes in an array and returns one without duplicates
                The slice() method creates a new array.
                The slice() method does not remove any elements from the source array.
                The slice() method can take two arguments like slice(1, 3).
                The method then selects elements from the start argument, and up to (but not including) the end argument.

-Insights: had forgotten Math.max and Math.min exist and tried to work with normal js ðŸ¥². It did work but ultimately took longer to write and added more lines to the code
-Code: days/day-01


### Day 2: 02/05/2025 - Object Manipulation
-Completed all exercises: 
                Write a function that merges two objects deeply (nested properties)
                Create a function that extracts specific properties from an object
                Implement a function that compares two objects for equality
                Build a function that creates an object from an array of key-value pairs

-Key Learnings: Objects use key value pairs ({key: value})
                Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.

-Insights: Objects are a major component of JavaScript and I intend to do more with them in this challenge

Code: days/day-02

### Day 3: 03/05/2025 - Practical String Operations
-Completed all exercises: 
                Create a string template engine that replaces {{variables}} with values
                Implement a function that validates different formats (email, phone, URL)
                Build a utility that transforms text between camelCase, snake_case, and kebab-case
                Write a function that extracts all links from a HTML string

-Key Learnings: JS has alot of string methods to allow string manipulation
                RegEx is a necessary skill for the manipulation of some string e.g. extraction from HTML string

-Insights: Should learn more RegEx

Code: days/day-03

### Day 4: 04/05/2025 - Functions & Scope
-Completed all exercises: 

Create a function that returns a memoized version of any function
Implement a function that limits how many times another function can be called
Write a function that executes a callback after a specified delay
Build a function that creates a throttled version of another function

-Key Learnings: 

Throttling is especially valuable for optimizing performance-sensitive event handlers.
The delayed function and callback gives you precise control over delayed operations with an elegant API.

-Insights: 

Today's challenge was all about maximizing performance

Code: days/day-04


### Day 5: 05/05/2025 - ES6 Features in Practice
-Completed all exercises: 

Refactor a complex function to use destructuring and default parameters
Convert a function to use rest/spread operators for flexibility
Implement a simple class hierarchy with inheritance
Create a set of utility functions using arrow functions and template literals

-Key Learnings: 

Arrow Functions make code more concise and maintain lexical this binding, which eliminates common scoping issues in callbacks and event handlers
Pure functions (like most utilities in the last exercise) produce consistent outputs for given inputs, improving predictability and testability
Function composition techniques (pipe and compose) allow building complex operations from simple ones, enhancing reusability

-Insights:  

Debounce and throttle are essential for handling high-frequency events like scrolling, resizing, or typing
Browser APIs like Intl provide robust internationalization without external libraries
Regular expressions are powerful but should be used judiciously and commented when complex (as in validation functions)
Utility functions should be small, focused, and composable rather than trying to do too much

Code: days/day-05

### Day 6: 06/05/2025 - Advanced JavaScript Patterns

-Completed all exercises:

Implemented retry mechanism for handling transient failures
Created waterfall function for sequential async operations
Built parallel execution utility with concurrency limits
Developed simple state machine implementation


-Key Learnings:

Retry patterns are essential for resilient network operations and API calls
Sequential execution (waterfall) provides control when each step depends on previous results
Concurrency management prevents overwhelming services while maintaining performance
State machines formalize complex workflows and prevent impossible state transitions


-Insights:

Error handling strategy differs significantly between sequential and parallel operations
Promise-based utilities can dramatically simplify complex asynchronous flows
Context objects provide cleaner data passing than long parameter lists
Well-designed patterns reduce cognitive load when reading/maintaining code



Code: days/day-06

- Key Learnings:

Promises are flexible abstractions for async control but require careful orchestration
Retrying and timeouts are essential for resilience in network-bound systems
Concurrency limiting improves performance without overwhelming resources
Wrapping legacy code with Promises improves maintainability and integration

-Insights:

Retry logic must balance between giving up too early and retrying forever â€” exponential backoff is a good compromise
Timeout utilities prevent UI and system hangs in unpredictable networks
Promise.race is a powerful pattern to combine competing async operations (e.g., timeout vs. result)
Splitting async workflows into small composable utilities improves readability and testability
Handling concurrency is a recurring pattern in APIs, file processing, and UI interactions

Code: days/day-08

### Day 9: 09/05/2025 - Fetch API & Data Handling

- Completed the following utilities:

        Fetch wrapper with built-in timeout and error handling using AbortController
        Lightweight caching layer using Map with TTL control
        API transformer utility to reshape response data before use
        Two-way sync function between API and localStorage

- Key Learnings

    AbortController is essential for fetch timeout control â€” especially for production apps
    Caching can dramatically improve performance and reduce API load, even with a simple TTL
    Transforming data before returning it helps reduce coupling between backend and frontend
    Using localStorage as a synchronization layer helps in offline-first strategies and improves UX

- Insights

    Learned to isolate concerns: fetching, transforming, caching, and persisting were all cleanly separated
    Recognized how many real-world apps quietly rely on transformation layers between raw API responses and UI consumption
    Map is a great structure for lightweight, in-memory caching; you donâ€™t always need Redux or IndexedDB
    Timing and TTL are subtle tools that can greatly improve perceived performance
    Mixing what I learned on Day 8 (timeouts, retry logic) added resilience to today's utilities

Code: days/day-09
ðŸ§  Confidence Level: Growing! Fetch and data shaping now feel easier to reason about and implement.

### Day 10: 10/05/2025 - Local Data Storage

- Completed implementation of:

        A localStorage wrapper that handles expiration and auto-removal
        A simple client-side database using IndexedDB with async/await support
        A sessionStorage utility that auto-cleans expired data
        A form syncing tool that saves user input to localStorage and restores it on load

- Key Learnings

    localStorage and sessionStorage are synchronous but powerful for lightweight persistence
    Expiry logic can be layered on top of browser storage to simulate TTL-based caching
    IndexedDB provides robust structured storage, suitable for larger or indexed datasets
    sessionStorage is ideal for temporary, session-limited state (e.g. forms, auth flow)
    Syncing UI with storage helps prevent user frustration from accidental data loss

- Insights

    Wrapping native browser storage in small utility modules makes code reusable and readable
    Combining form syncing with storage expiration can simulate autosave features like in Notion or Google Docs
    Using JSON.stringify() for storage is simple, but care must be taken to validate structure on retrieval
    IndexedDB has quirks, but async/await helps manage it without callback hell
    Learning to persist UI state improves the perceived reliability of your app
    
Code: days/day-10
ðŸ§  Confidence Level: Higher! More fluent in client-side storage strategies and async browser APIs.


### Day 11: 11/05/2025 - Event Handling

- Completed:
        A clean and reusable pub/sub system for decoupled communication
        Event delegation pattern for handling dynamically added elements
        Debounce and throttle utilities to improve performance of frequent events
        Centralized event listener manager for easier cleanup and memory safety

- Key Learnings
        Custom event systems are powerful for decoupled architecture
        Event delegation simplifies dynamic UIs by reducing the number of listeners
        Debounce avoids unnecessary triggers (e.g., live search), while throttle controls pace (e.g., scroll)
        Managing and cleaning up listeners is essential in SPAs to avoid memory leaks

- Insights

        The pub/sub model could scale into a more robust state or signal system later
        Clean event handling code makes your app feel more performant and reliable
        DOM performance improves significantly when using delegation for large/complex trees
        I now better appreciate how modularizing utility logic like debounce, throttle, or event manager keeps the UI layer lightweight

Code: days/day-11
ðŸ§  Confidence Level: Improving! Handling real UI events now feels more intuitive and controlled.


### Day 12: 12/05/2025 - Form Validation & Handling
- Completed:
        Custom validation engine with reusable rules
        Functions for form data serialization and restoration
        Auto-save and resume form state via localStorage
        File upload handling with real-time preview for images

- Key Learnings
        Creating my own validation logic gave me full control over UI and error handling
        Serializing forms simplifies autosave, previews, and draft saving workflows
        Handling partial progress and restoring state improves UX significantly
        File input behavior is nuanced â€” previewing image files brings a smoother experience

- Insights
        Validation logic can be modular, functional, and flexible â€” no need for large libraries
        HTML5â€™s FormData is a hidden gem for both traditional form submission and state capture
        Saving form progress with input events mimics real-world autosave systems
        File previews add professionalism to forms, especially for images, profiles, and uploads

Code: days/day-12
ðŸ§  Confidence Level: High! Forms used to feel complex â€” now they feel like manageable mini apps.

### Day 13: 13/05/2025 - Date & Time Manipulation
- Completed:
        Lightweight date formatting utility with multiple presets

        Date difference calculator with support for different units

        Smart scheduling tool that accounts for business hours/days

        Countdown timer with pause/resume/reset capability

- Key Learnings
        Date objects are mutable â€” it's easy to make off-by-one or timezone errors if careless

        Working with units (days, hours, etc.) is clearer when abstracted into utility functions

        Business logic (like only operating Monâ€“Fri, 9â€“5) is critical for scheduling apps

        Countdown logic mimics real-world UI behaviors (e.g., quizzes, timers, productivity tools)

- Insights
        Localized formatting via toLocaleString() gives flexibility without needing libraries

        Scheduling tools need to be strict with edge cases (weekends, off-hours)

        Countdown timers are a solid async challenge, especially with pause/reset logic

        Date/time utilities are useful in any app involving reminders, timers, or logs

Code: days/day-13
ðŸ§  Confidence Level: Strengthening! Date logic used to be intimidating, but breaking it into utilities makes it much easier to reason about.


### Day 14: 14/05/2025 â€“ Project: Weather Dashboard

        Learned to manage async operations with multiple fetches and error boundaries

        Practice with real-world data formats and parsing APIs

        DOM updates based on dynamic user input and local state

        API token security and query optimization for performance

        Clear separation of responsibilities: UI rendering, API handling, state storage

- Insights
        Wrapping API interactions in utilities helps with reuse and testing

        Modular design makes adding features (like 5-day forecast or dark mode) easier

        Project brought together skills from previous days: form handling, fetch, localStorage, and event delegation

        Better appreciation of user experience flow in real apps

Code: days/day-14
ðŸ§  Confidence Level: Growing! Real API integration felt like a milestone â€” managing both data and UX made things click

### Day 15: 15/05/2025 -- DOM Manipulation

- Completed Features
        Built dynamic HTML elements purely with JavaScript

        Created a mini template engine (useful for future templating)

        Practiced efficient DOM updates using fragments

        Handled animations smoothly with requestAnimationFrame

- Key Learnings

        DOM creation from structured data gives flexibility for UI rendering

        Template strings can be powerful when customized

        Performance matters: minimizing reflows with fragments boosts speed

        Manual animations help understand timing and repaint cycles

- Insights

        These patterns resemble how frameworks (React, Vue) manage the DOM behind the scenes

        Gained appreciation for separation of data and presentation

        Writing animations from scratch made the event loop and rendering pipeline clearer
