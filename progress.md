# My 30-Day JavaScript Challenge Progress


## Overview
- Start Date: 01/05/2025
- Target Completion Date: 30/05/2025
- Days Completed: 22/30
- Current Streak: 22 days

## Daily Log
### Day 1: 01/05/2025 - Working with Arrays
-Completed all exercises: 
        Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns statistics (min, max, mean, median)

        Implement a function that chunks an array into groups of a specified size

        Write a function that removes duplicates from an array using multiple approaches

        Create a utility that finds the intersection of two arrays

                
-Key learnings: filter and reduce are powerful array methods
        indexOf() returns a -1 when the element passed to it is not found, hence why it has been used in the for loop to remove duplicates in an array

        indexOf() always returns the first occurrence of the element in an array, hence being very useful in removing duplicates

        Another method to remove duplicates is using Set() which takes in an array and returns one without duplicates

        The slice() method creates a new array.

        The slice() method does not remove any elements from the source array.

        The slice() method can take two arguments like slice(1, 3).

        The method then selects elements from the start argument, and up to (but not including) the end argument.


-Insights: had forgotten Math.max and Math.min exist and tried to work with normal js 🥲. It did work but ultimately took longer to write and added more lines to the code
-Code: days/day-01


### Day 2: 02/05/2025 - Object Manipulation
-Completed all exercises: 
        Write a function that merges two objects deeply (nested properties)
        
        Create a function that extracts specific properties from an object
        
        Implement a function that compares two objects for equality
        
        Build a function that creates an object from an array of key-value pairs


-Key Learnings: Objects use key value pairs ({key: value})
        Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.

-Insights: Objects are a major component of JavaScript and I intend to do more with them in this challenge

Code: days/day-02

### Day 3: 03/05/2025 - Practical String Operations
-Completed all exercises: 
        Create a string template engine that replaces {{variables}} with values

        Implement a function that validates different formats (email, phone, URL)

        Build a utility that transforms text between camelCase, snake_case, and kebab-case

        Write a function that extracts all links from a HTML string


-Key Learnings: JS has alot of string methods to allow string manipulation

        RegEx is a necessary skill for the manipulation of some string e.g. extraction from HTML string


-Insights: Should learn more RegEx

Code: days/day-03

### Day 4: 04/05/2025 - Functions & Scope
-Completed all exercises: 

        Create a function that returns a memoized version of any function

        Implement a function that limits how many times another function can be called

        Write a function that executes a callback after a specified delay

        Build a function that creates a throttled version of another function


-Key Learnings: 

        Throttling is especially valuable for optimizing performance-sensitive event handlers.

        The delayed function and callback gives you precise control over delayed operations with an elegant API.

### Day 5: 05/05/2025 - ES6 Features in Practice
-Completed all exercises: 

        Refactor a complex function to use destructuring and default parameters

        Convert a function to use rest/spread operators for flexibility

        Implement a simple class hierarchy with inheritance

        Create a set of utility functions using arrow functions and template literals


-Key Learnings: 

        Arrow Functions make code more concise and maintain lexical this binding, which eliminates common scoping issues in callbacks and event handlers

        Pure functions (like most utilities in the last exercise) produce consistent outputs for given inputs, improving predictability and testability

        Function composition techniques (pipe and compose) allow building complex operations from simple ones, enhancing reusability


-Insights:  

        Debounce and throttle are essential for handling high-frequency events like scrolling, resizing, or typing

        Browser APIs like Intl provide robust internationalization without external libraries

        Regular expressions are powerful but should be used judiciously and commented when complex (as in validation functions)

        Utility functions should be small, focused, and composable rather than trying to do too much

### Day 8: 08/05/2025 - Promise Patterns
- Completed Implementations:

        promisify: Converted callback-based functions to return Promises

        retryWithBackoff: Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff

        promiseTimeout: Added timeout control for long-running Promises

        runWithConcurrency: Managed concurrent Promise execution with a defined limit


- Key Learnings:

        Promises are flexible abstractions for async control but require careful orchestration

        Retrying and timeouts are essential for resilience in network-bound systems

        Concurrency limiting improves performance without overwhelming resources

        Wrapping legacy code with Promises improves maintainability and integration


-Insights:

        Retry logic must balance between giving up too early and retrying forever — exponential backoff is a good compromise

        Timeout utilities prevent UI and system hangs in unpredictable networks

        Promise.race is a powerful pattern to combine competing async operations (e.g., timeout vs. result)

        Splitting async workflows into small composable utilities improves readability and testability

        Handling concurrency is a recurring pattern in APIs, file processing, and UI interactions


Code: days/day-08

        Lightweight caching layer using Map with TTL control

        API transformer utility to reshape response data before use

        Two-way sync function between API and localStorage


- Key Learnings

        AbortController is essential for fetch timeout control — especially for production apps

        Caching can dramatically improve performance and reduce API load, even with a simple TTL

        Transforming data before returning it helps reduce coupling between backend and frontend

        Using localStorage as a synchronization layer helps in offline-first strategies and improves UX


- Insights

        Learned to isolate concerns: fetching, transforming, caching, and persisting were all cleanly separated

        Recognized how many real-world apps quietly rely on transformation layers between raw API responses and UI consumption

        Map is a great structure for lightweight, in-memory caching; you don’t always need Redux or IndexedDB

        Timing and TTL are subtle tools that can greatly improve perceived performance

        Mixing what I learned on Day 8 (timeouts, retry logic) added resilience to today's utilities


Code: days/day-09

        A sessionStorage utility that auto-cleans expired data

        A form syncing tool that saves user input to localStorage and restores it on load


- Key Learnings

        localStorage and sessionStorage are synchronous but powerful for lightweight persistence

        Expiry logic can be layered on top of browser storage to simulate TTL-based caching

        IndexedDB provides robust structured storage, suitable for larger or indexed datasets

        sessionStorage is ideal for temporary, session-limited state (e.g. forms, auth flow)

        Syncing UI with storage helps prevent user frustration from accidental data loss


- Insights

        Wrapping native browser storage in small utility modules makes code reusable and readable

        Combining form syncing with storage expiration can simulate autosave features like in Notion or Google Docs

        Using JSON.stringify() for storage is simple, but care must be taken to validate structure on retrieval

        IndexedDB has quirks, but async/await helps manage it without callback hell

        Learning to persist UI state improves the perceived reliability of your app

    
Code: days/day-10

- Key Learnings
        Custom event systems are powerful for decoupled architecture

        Event delegation simplifies dynamic UIs by reducing the number of listeners

        Debounce avoids unnecessary triggers (e.g., live search), while throttle controls pace (e.g., scroll)

        Managing and cleaning up listeners is essential in SPAs to avoid memory leaks


- Insights

        The pub/sub model could scale into a more robust state or signal system later

        Clean event handling code makes your app feel more performant and reliable

        DOM performance improves significantly when using delegation for large/complex trees

        I now better appreciate how modularizing utility logic like debounce, throttle, or event manager keeps the UI layer lightweight

        Developed an autocomplete engine for input suggestions  
        
        Added a regex-based pattern matcher across data  
        

📚 Key Learnings  

        Regex is powerful but should be used carefully for performance  
        
        Sorting strategies matter for UX (e.g., alphabetical vs numeric)  
        
        Autocomplete enhances usability with minimal overhead  
        
        Data normalization (e.g., toLowerCase) is crucial for fair comparisons  
        

💡 Insights  

        Even small UI features rely on solid algorithmic logic  
        
        Regex patterns can simulate fuzzy matching with tweaks  
        
        Modular design makes it easy to swap sorting/searching logic  
        
        Filtering and sorting can be combined for richer interactivity
