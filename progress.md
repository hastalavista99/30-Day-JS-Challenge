## Daily Log
### Day 1: 01/05/2025 - Working with Arrays
-Completed all exercises
-Key learnings: filter and reduce are powerful array methods
                indexOf() returns a -1 when the element passed to it is not found, hence why it has been used in the for loop to remove duplicates in an array
                indexOf() always returns the first occurrence of the element in an array, hence being very useful in removing duplicates
                Another method to remove duplicates is using Set() which takes in an array and returns one without duplicates
                The slice() method creates a new array.
                The slice() method does not remove any elements from the source array.
                The slice() method can take two arguments like slice(1, 3).
                The method then selects elements from the start argument, and up to (but not including) the end argument.

-Insights: had forgotten Math.max and Math.min exist and tried to work with normal js ðŸ¥². It did work but ultimately took longer to write and added more lines to the code
